You walk down the long stretch of hallway through the administration building. You make it about halfway through when suddenly, you spot him.
The school bully, smugly strutting down the hallway as if nothing in this world is capable of stopping him. With no one else in the hallway,
he locks his eyes on you. Sweat starts running down your face as you worry about what he could possibly be plotting. He trots up to you, and
begins speaking.

Mr Chen: Hey! Gimme all your money!!

You don't know how the 60 year old substitute teacher became the school bully, but I suppose no one's life path is set in stone.
