You feel a little ashamed that your life has come to this, but if this is what you need to get your schedule, so be it.\n\nYou take a look around the room. It's pretty barebones. On the wall is a number of certificates and plaques hung up. Looking back, you see Mr Tran has once again returned to sleep at his desk. Next to which is a small plastic trash can. To your right is the door leading out of the room",
