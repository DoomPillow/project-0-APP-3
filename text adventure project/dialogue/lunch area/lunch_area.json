    "text": "Before you is the boundless, idyllic beauty of the PHS Eastern Quad. Various metal tables dot the area, all painted a patriotic bulldog-red. The glourious statue of Biggy D lies in the center of the quad. To the right is the entrance to the cafeteria, as well as the gates to the Garden. To your left, you see a stand set up by the military, where two people dressed up in camo gear stand. Further up the quad, you see someone relaxing on a colorful deckchair, beneath a bright blue and pink sun umbrella. Upon further inspection, you see that person to be Mr Tran.",
