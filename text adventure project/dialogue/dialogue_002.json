Don't worry, I can solve that no problem.\n\nHe pulls open a drawer in his desk and takes out a big red crayon. He then flips over some paper already on his desk and scribbles a schedule onto it.\n\nMr Tran: Let me just pull up your schedule on Aeries here.... one moment.... there! Here you go!\n\nAfter quickly giving it to you, he begins to lean back and return to his slumber.[unlock 2][lock 3][warp 1]",
